# angelscripts-install-as-daemon

Angel scripts for deploying organic cells on `vps` infrastructure as root cells.

Root cells are those cells running under `root` user :warning:.

## How to install

The minimal version of nodejs is: `Nodejs version 4+`

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install angelscripts-install-as-daemon --save-dev
```

## VPS requirements

`angelscripts-install-as-daemon` requires `Ubuntu` version 14.04+ or Debian version 7+

## Testing

Organelle doesn't have a test section. Why ?

Simulation of vps is really a tough task and for us is wasting of time.

If you project requires 100% test coverage you're more than welcome to fork this repo.
